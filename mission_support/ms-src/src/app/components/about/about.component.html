    There is currently no global platform available for medical organizations to share information or resources despite many visiting the same areas. A couple of the problems that result from this lack of cooperation are resources being lost and individual medical organizations expending time to build institutional knowledge from the ground up. Resources are lost either going through customs or when extra medical supplies are confiscated by local governments and then have to be bought by proceeding medical organizations. Mission Support goal is to provide a successful solution that would allow for this exchange of information and provide a hub for communication through web and mobile support.</p>
