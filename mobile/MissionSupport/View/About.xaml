Problems that result from this lack of cooperation include resource loss and individual medical organizations expending time to build institutional knowledge from the ground up. Resources are lost either going through customs or when extra medical supplies are confiscated by local governments and then have to be bought by proceeding medical organizations. Our goal is to provide a successful solution that would allow for an exchange of information and a hub for communication through web and mobile support." ></Label>
